Instead of pulling from an API we opted to find already created DataSets since video games themselves are a popular topic in general.

Our story would begin with not how we compiled the data but rather what did we do with it.

Since we knew that the there would be a greater effort of time and coding just to predict the components of a successful video game, we decided on an unsupervised ML approach.
Like a certain article explained it "The process of inferring underlying hidden patterns from historical data. Within such an approach, a machine learning model tries to find any similarities, differences, patterns, and structure in data by itself. No prior human intervention is needed. Picture a toddler. The child knows what the family cat looks like (provided they have one) but has no idea that there are a lot of other cats in the world that are all different. The thing is, if the kid sees another cat, he or she will still be able to recognize it as a cat through a set of features such as two ears, four legs, a tail, fur, whiskers, etc." <a href="https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/unsupervised-machine-learning/"</a>.


In machine learning, this kind of prediction is called unsupervised learning. But when parents tell the child that the new animal is a cat – drumroll – that’s considered supervised learning.
This particular data set contains the Name, Platform, Summary/Plot, Metacritic Rating and User Rating.
There is about 18801 rows of data. The question is how can this assist with our current data set.
